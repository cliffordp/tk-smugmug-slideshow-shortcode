== Installation ==

After automatically installing to wp-content/plugins/:

1. Install the Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin (you'll be prompted to do so if it's not already installed and activated). It's optional but highly recommended.
2. Just use the shortcode in any Visual Editor (e.g. Post/Page edit screens). With Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin activated you'll be able to click "Add Media" then "Insert Post Element" then select one of the shortcodes to customize.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**What are some shortcode examples?**

Here are some shortcode examples:

* MDL Tooltip: `[mdl-tooltip text="XML"]eXtensible Markup Language[/mdl-tooltip]`

*Don't forget most of these shortcodes have a user interface (UI) to make it easy to create them (so you don't have to manually enter all that shortcode garbly-gook).*

**Does MDL Shortcodes work with my theme?**

The styling of all these components is essentially self-contained. Due to the nature of implementing the shortcodes (they require the Icon Font, CSS, and JS files to be loaded), this plugin can feel like it "takes over" your theme's styling. In summary, yes, it should WORK with your theme (not cause PHP or other errors), but it may not LOOK GREAT with your theme (although that doesn't mean it can't with some tweaks).
