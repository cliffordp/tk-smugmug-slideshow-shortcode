== Installation ==

After automatically installing to wp-content/plugins/:

1. Install the Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin (you'll be prompted to do so if it's not already installed and activated). It's optional but highly recommended.
2. Just use the shortcode in any Visual Editor (e.g. Post/Page edit screens). With Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin activated you'll be able to click "Add Media" then "Insert Post Element" then select one of the shortcodes to customize.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**What are some shortcode examples?**

Here are some shortcode examples:

* At the least, the SmugMug Album Key is required: `[smugmug-slideshow key="TrBCmb"]`
* A variety of shortcode arguments: `[smugmug-slideshow domain="media.tourkick.com" key="TrBCmb" autostart_off="true" navigation="true" playbutton="true" height="400"]`
* By default, width is set to 100% (responsive), but here's an example of how to make it fixed width: `[smugmug-slideshow key="TrBCmb" width="450" widthunits="px"]`


*Don't forget: This shortcode has a user interface (UI) to make it easy to generate or edit `[smugmug-slideshow]` in the Visual Editor (so you don't have to manually enter all that shortcode garbly-gook).*

**Does the shortcode work with my theme?**

Yes. It's just an iframe.

**Does the shortcode work over SSL/HTTPS?**

Yes (as of version 1.5) as long as you use the "smugmug.com" domain (which is the default) or your custom SmugMug subdomain (e.g. tourkick.smugmug.com, *not* your media.tourkick.com CNAME domain).

== Changelog ==
*Changelog DIFFs for all versions are available at <a href="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tk-smugmug-slideshow-shortcode/trunk" target="_blank">WordPress SVN</a>.*

= Version 1.6 =
* March 5, 2019

= Version 1.5 =
* May 27, 2017
* Added HTTPS/SSL support. If the shortcode's "domain" argument ends with 'smugmug.com' (e.g. xyz.smugmug.com), the slideshow will load via HTTPS, else HTTP. Really, though, you could just leave the "domain" argument empty to load it from https://smugmug.com/..., which should work in all cases.
* Added 'randomize' shortcode argument
* Added tk_smugmug_slideshow_shortcode_before_output and tk_smugmug_slideshow_shortcode_after_output filters in case you want to add your own button that links to view the full screen slideshow (same link as the generated iframe src).
* Integrated Freemius.

= Version 1.4 =
* January 30, 2017
* Technically no version change from 1.3 but somehow the plugin's version was set at 1.4. Either I missed a readme update or ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so we'll call it v1.4...
* Readme updated to include link to Chrome extension, specify that others’ SmugMug galleries could be used too, and that this plugin has been tested working with WordPress 4.7.2

= Version 1.3 =
* November 25, 2015
* Fix check for global $content_width (!empty instead of isset to avoid iframe width of zero).
* Added esc_url() to iframe src to improve HTML validation and security.

= Version 1.2 =
* November 21, 2015
* Fix plugin header to avoid error with attempt to activate plugin upon initial installation (included TGM Plugin Activation had valid plugin header info and WP scans down another directory looking for additional plugins)
